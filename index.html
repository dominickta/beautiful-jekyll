    "Dominick was the first person to expose me to many of the computer science contents. He pioneered a crash course during our winter break, tutoring me along with two other peers. Having little experience with JAVA, he clearly explained the foundation that one needs to know to succeed in CSE 142 at the University of Washington. Dominick has an innate ability to teach and continues to offer his help and support beyond computer science. He was a very exceptional peer tutor. Thank you for being patient with me!" </br>
